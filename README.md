# Using ChatGPT to create a brief learning curriculum

I am experimenting with different methods to generate linear educational progressions within my coding, as I've been struggling with direction lately.

## Goals

- To identify and lock down some key areas in which I need to improve.
- To become more fluid with applying what I already know.
- To further continue my overall understanding and maintain consistency.
- Incorporate numpy where relevant to gain further understanding in its application.
