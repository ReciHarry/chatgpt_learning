# Using ChatGPT to create a brief learning curriculum

I am experimenting with different methods to generate linear educational progressions within my coding.

## Goals

- To identify and lock down some key areas in which I need to improve.
- To become more fluid with applying what I already know.
- To further continue my overall understanding and maintain consistency.
- Incorporate numpy where relevant to gain further understanding in its application.

### Outlined Exercises (As Provided By ChatGPT)

Arrays: Learn how to efficiently organize and manipulate collections of related data by using arrays, numbered structures that hold elements of the same type accessible through index-based referencing.

Functions: Learn how to define and use functions to modularize your code and make it more organized and reusable.

Visual Representation: Acquire proficiency in harnessing graphical elements as instruments for conveying information. Further delve into the diverse applications and enhanced capabilities offered by graphs in data presentation and exploration.

Control Structures: Explore concepts like loops (for and while) and conditional statements (if, else, elif) to control the flow of your programs.

Data Structures: Move beyond arrays to explore more advanced data structures like lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples. Understand their properties and use cases.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Dive into the world of OOP, including classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. This approach is crucial for building complex applications.

File Handling: Learn how to read from and write to files, which is important for tasks like data persistence and configuration management.

Error Handling: Understand how to handle exceptions and errors gracefully in your code to improve robustness.

Algorithms: Start exploring basic algorithms and their analysis. This is essential for solving problems efficiently.

Libraries and Frameworks: Explore popular libraries and frameworks related to your interests. For example, if you're interested in data analysis, you might learn about NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib in Python.

Database Management: Learn about databases, SQL, and data modeling. This is crucial for building applications that involve data storage.

Version Control: Start using version control systems like Git to manage and collaborate on code projects effectively.

Software Design Patterns: Explore common design patterns that help structure your code in a scalable and maintainable way.
